            <h1>Introduction To java</h1>
            <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and now
                owned by Oracle. It is known for its principle of **"Write Once, Run Anywhere"**, meaning Java code can
                run
                on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it platform-independent. Java is widely used for
                building desktop, web, and mobile applications, especially for Android. It is secure, simple, robust,
                and
                supports multithreading, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously. Java’s syntax is similar to C++,
                but
                it removes complex features like pointers to make programming easier and safer.
            </p>
            <h2>Features of java</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple:
                    Java is easy to learn and has a clean syntax, avoiding complex features like pointers.</li>
                <li>Object-Oriented :
                    Java uses concepts like classes and objects to organize code in a modular and reusable way.
                </li>
                <li>Platform Independent :
                    Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which runs on any device with a JVM.

                </li>
                <li>Secure :
                    Java provides a secure execution environment by avoiding direct memory access and using the JVM.

                </li>
                <li>Robust :
                    Java has strong error-handling (exception handling), memory management, and type checking.

                </li>
                <li>Multithreaded :
                    Java allows multiple threads (tasks) to run at the same time, improving performance.

                </li>
                <li>Architecture Neutral :
                    Java bytecode is independent of the system architecture, making it compatible with any device.

                </li>
                <li>Portable :
                    Java code can easily move between platforms without modifications.

                </li>
                <li>High Performance :
                    Java uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to increase execution speed compared to other interpreted
                    languages.

                </li>
                <li>Dynamic :
                    Java can dynamically load and link new classes during program execution.

                </li>

                <li>Distributed :
                    Java supports distributed computing using built-in networking and RMI features.

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
            <pre style="background-color: antiquewhite;">// This is a simple Java program
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    
    }

}
</pre>
            <ul>
                <li>public class HelloWorld :

                    Defines the class named HelloWorld. Every Java program must have at least one class.

                </li>
                <li>public static void main(String[] args) :

                    The starting point of the program. Java looks for this method to begin execution.

                </li>
                <li>System.out.println("Hello, World!");

                    Prints the text Hello, World! to the console.

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Applications of java</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Android App Development :
                    Java is the core language for building Android mobile apps.

                </li>
                <li>Web Applications :
                    Java is widely used for server-side development (e.g., using Spring, JSP).

                </li>
                <li>Enterprise Applications :
                    Java powers large business systems in banking, finance, and government (via Java EE).

                </li>
                <li>Desktop Applications :
                    Java is used to build cross-platform GUI apps with JavaFX or Swing.

                </li>
                <li>Cloud Computing and Big Data :
                    Java is used in tools like Hadoop and is supported in cloud platforms (AWS, Azure).

        <section id="c">
            <h2> Introduction Of Array</h2>
            <p>An array in Java is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations,
                which can be accessed using an index. It is used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead
                of declaring separate variables for each value.
            </p>
            <img src="../ar.img.jpg" width="100%" height="500" alt="loading">
            <h3>Charactorstics Of Array</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed Size :

                    Once created, the size of the array cannot be changed.

                </li>
                <li>Same Data Type :

                    All elements must be of the same data type.

                </li>
                <li>Indexed Access :

                    Elements are accessed using index numbers starting from 0.

                </li>
                <li>Array is an Object :

                    In Java, every array is an object, even for primitive types.

                </li>
                <li>Length Property :

                    Arrays have a built-in length property to get the number of elements.

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Types Of Array</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>One-Dimensional Array (1D) :
                    Stores a list of elements in a single row. It is used for linear data like a list of numbers or
                    names.

                </li>
                <li>Two-Dimensional Array (2D) :
                    Stores data in the form of rows and columns (like a table). Commonly used for matrix-related
                    problems.

                </li>
                <li>Multi-Dimensional Array :
                    An extension of 2D arrays — used for complex data structures (e.g., 3D, 4D arrays), but rarely used
                    in practice.

                </li>
            </ol>

        <section id="d">
            <h2> Introduction Of Tree</h2>
            <p>A Tree in Java is a non-linear data structure made up of nodes, where one node is designated as the root,
                and all other nodes are connected by edges forming a hierarchical structure. Each node can have zero or
                more child nodes, and there are no cycles in a tree.
            </p>
            <img src="../tree.img.jpg" width="100%" height="500" alt="loading">
            <h3>Charactorstics Of Tree</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hierarchical Structure :
                    A tree organizes data in a parent-child relationship, starting from a root node.



                </li>
                <li>Root Node :
                    The topmost node of a tree, from which all other nodes branch out.


                </li>
                <li>Nodes and Edges :
                    A tree is made up of nodes (data points) connected by edges (links).


                </li>
                <li>One Parent Rule :
                    Every child node has only one parent (except the root, which has none).



                </li>
                <li>Leaf Nodes :
                    Nodes with no children are called leaves.


                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Types Of Tree</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Binary Tree :
                    A tree where each node has at most two children — called the left and right child. It is the
                    foundation of many other tree types.

                </li>
                <li>Binary Search Tree (BST) :
                    A special type of binary tree where the left child is smaller than the parent, and the right child
                    is greater. It is used for fast searching, insertion, and deletion.



                </li>
                <li>AVL Tree :
                    A self-balancing binary search tree. After every insertion or deletion, it balances itself to ensure
                    operations remain fast (O(log n) time).


                </li>
                <li>Red-Black Tree :
                    Another type of self-balancing binary search tree. It is used internally in Java's TreeMap and
                    TreeSet to keep data sorted and ensure quick access.



                </li>
                <li>Heap (Binary Heap) :
                    A complete binary tree used to implement priority queues. In a max heap, the largest element is at
                    the root; in a min heap, the smallest is at the root.



                </li>
                <li>Trie (Prefix Tree) :
                    A tree structure used to store and search strings efficiently, especially useful in auto-complete
                    and dictionary applications.


                </li>

        <section id="e">
            <h2> Introduction Of Graph</h2>
            <p>A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of a set of nodes (called vertices) and connections
                between them (called edges). Graphs are used to represent networks like social media, road maps,
                computer networks, etc.

            </p>
            <img src="../graph.img.jpg" width="100%" height="500" alt="loading">
            <h3>Charactorstics Of Graph</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Vertices and Edges :
                    A graph is made up of nodes (vertices) and connections (edges) between them.
                </li>
                <li>Direction (Optional) :
                    Graphs can be directed (edges have a direction) or undirected (edges go both ways).



                </li>
                <li>Cyclic or Acyclic :
                    Graphs may have cycles (a path that starts and ends at the same node) or may be acyclic.


                </li>
                <li>Connectedness :
                    A graph is connected if there is a path between every pair of vertices.

                </li>
                <li>Sparse or Dense :
                    A graph is sparse if it has fewer edges and dense if it has many edges compared to the number of
                    vertices.



                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Types Of Graphs</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Directed Graph (Digraph) :
                    In this graph, edges have a direction — from one vertex to another.
                    Example: Twitter (follow relationship).



                </li>
                <li>Undirected Graph :
                    Edges have no direction — the connection goes both ways.
                    Example: Facebook (friendship relationship).


                </li>
                <li>Weighted Graph :
                    Each edge has a weight (cost, distance, time, etc.).
                    Example: Road maps with distances.


                </li>
                <li>Unweighted Graph :
                    Edges have no weight — just show connection or relationship.
                    Example: Simple social networks.

                </li>
                <li>Cyclic Graph :
                    A graph that contains at least one cycle — a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.

                </li>
                <li>Acyclic Graph :
                    A graph with no cycles — commonly used in scheduling or dependency problems</li>
                <li>Connected Graph :
                    All vertices are reachable from each other (in undirected graphs).

                </li>
                <li>Disconnected Graph :
                    Some vertices are not reachable from others — the graph is broken into parts.

                </li>
                <li>Complete Graph :
                    Every vertex is connected to every other vertex directly.

                </li>
            </ol>
